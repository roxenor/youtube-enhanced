# YouTube enhanced app
Unofficial YouTube app for Windows computers.

This repository explains all the steps performed to create this app, because it is safer to know what is under the hood of apps you use.

General knowledges and thoughts:
* YouTube has blocked most of adblockers
* In a near future, we can expect that no adblocker will work on any chromium based browser (every browser except Firefox)
* Some users do not want to switch definitly to Firefox, but would like to enjoy YouTube without paying premium
* A custom portable version of Firefox can be created, to "act" as a Youtube app
* It is safer to avoid intermediates softwares such as portable app as much as possible

I made this app by following these steps:

* Manually create a portable version of Firefox, following the steps explained [here](https://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=2821799) (B.2 and C.)
* Install ublock origin
* Set default start page to youtube.com

## How to install

* unzip the lastest release [here]
* open the unzipped folder
* check that "YouTube enhancer shortcut" works by double click on it (success if Firefox starts)
* copy paste this shortcut where you want (e.g. on your desktop)
* enjoy YouTube ! you can connect to your google account if you want

## Future

Next updates, I will :

* Make a shortcut to enable user to quickly launch YouTube app, make it relative [ref.](https://superuser.com/questions/644407/using-relative-paths-for-windows-shortcuts)
